# Computer Vision Algorithms and Applications

This repository tracks my step-by-step journey through foundational concepts in **Image Processing** and **Computer Vision**. <br>
The learning is based on the lecture series: **[First Principles of Computer Vision](https://fpcv.cs.columbia.edu/)** and the book **Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications** by Richard Szeliski, combined with hands-on coding implementations and deep dives into the math and geometry involved.

## Goals

- Implement all key concepts in Python from scratch.
- Build a portfolio of visual demos, simulations, and experiments.
- Track concepts, formulas, and insights in markdown notes.
